<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou would not have imagined that merely migrating a AngularJS SPA application onto AWS S3 or any other static file host would have been so troublesome. Suddenly, you are faced with issues such as deep-linked URLs not working and search engines not being able to decipher your pages properly.</p>

In my [previous article]({% post_url 2015-11-10-angularjs-with-html5-mode-on-s3 %}), I provided a solution for enabling pretty HTML5 mode URLs in AngularJS on AWS S3 so that deep-linked URLs can now function properly. Today, let us discuss how we can enable proper SEO (search engine optimization) for AngularJS on AWS S3.

I know there has been a lot of talk about [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io/) and how it can prerender your web application so that it is SEO-friendly. I would say Prerender.io is actually a very *misleading* service because it claims that it can allow your javascript website to be crawled perfectly by search engines, but that is of course only if you are using a custom server to serve your files. Once you understand how Prerender.io works after much research, you will then discover that it does not actually fit the bill for AngularJS or Javascript SPA applications on static file hosts like AWS S3, Github Pages, and so forth.

Prerender.io provides a dynamic solution to either display the original page or a pre-generated snapshot, but it requires a request to the server for it to work. If you have your AngularJS SPA application on AWS S3, you simply can't relay the request to your server. In other words, Prerender.io is not an all-encompassing solution for javascript applications. Simply put, you can forget about Prerender.io if you are serving your site directly from AWS S3. What you need is a **static and genuinely pre-rendered** solution.

*As a disclaimer, the solution I am going to provide may not work in certain cases due to different or incompatible coding practices or architectures.*

### Grunt Prerender ###

In a bid for a more automated solution to make my AngularJS SPA application on AWS S3 SEO friendly, I created the [grunt-prerender](https://github.com/ericluwj/grunt-prerender) Grunt tool that creates pre-rendered HTML snapshots for static file serving purposes.

The main solution is actually very simple.

Let's say you have a URL `http://www.mysite.com/faq/` that you want to be SEO-friendly. Upon a GET request, a file server will naturally first look for an index file, e.g. `index.html`, in the `faq` directory of the root directory and serve it, based on the path of the URL. If this is an AngularJS or Javascript SPA application, obviously a `index.html` file will not exist in the `faq` directory, because what should be served should be the `index.html` in the root directory.

Hence, a natural solution would be then to place a pre-generated HTML snapshot of the URL `http://www.mysite.com/faq/` as `index.html` in the `faq` directory. The main difference between this pre-generated HTML snaphot at the URL `http://www.mysite.com/faq/` and `index.html` in the root directory will be that the former already has the **content** of the URL `http://www.mysite.com/faq/` populated inside already, unlike the original plain `index.html`.

This solves the SEO for content marketing issue. If the search engine is only able to find the original `index.html` SPA template, whatever content is in it is probably more or less all of the content crawled for your website, so that is terrible SEO.

Using the [grunt-prerender](https://github.com/ericluwj/grunt-prerender) tool, it is now possible to generate all these static HTML snapshots for all relevant URLs that you want to be SEOed, and then to upload them to AWS S3 or any other static file host.

You could simply install [grunt-prerender](https://github.com/ericluwj/grunt-prerender) in your project with:

    npm install grunt-prerender --save-dev

Here are snippets of my own production Grunt workflow to automate this prerendering. What I do is to simply use the [grunt-prerender](https://github.com/ericluwj/grunt-prerender) tool to generate all my HTML snaphots before uploading them back to my production S3 bucket using the [grunt-aws-s3](https://github.com/MathieuLoutre/grunt-aws-s3) tool. If you are already thinking of SEO for your website, I am sure you should definitely have generated a `sitemap.xml`. But in any case, you are still able to input a list of URLs to the tool instead.

{% highlight javascript %}
grunt.initConfig({

  // Empties folders to start fresh
  clean: {
    server: '.tmp'
  },

  aws_s3: {
    options: {
      accessKeyId: localConfig.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
      secretAccessKey: localConfig.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
      region: localConfig.AWS_S3_REGION,
      uploadConcurrency: 5, // 5 simultaneous uploads
      downloadConcurrency: 5 // 5 simultaneous downloads
    },
    upload_prerender: {
      options: {
        bucket: 'www.mysite.com',
        progress: 'progressBar'
      },
      files: [
        {expand: true, cwd: '.tmp/snapshots/', src: ['**'], dest: '/', params: {CacheControl: 'no-cache'}}
      ]
    }
  },

  prerender: {
    production: {
      options: {
        sitemap: 'http://www.mysite.com/sitemap.xml',
        dest: '.tmp/snapshots/'
      }
    }
  }
});

grunt.registerTask('s3prerender', function () {
  grunt.task.run([
    'clean:server',
    'prerender',
    'aws_s3:upload_prerender'
  ]);
});
{% endhighlight %}

As a caveat, there are a few pointers you might want to take note to be able to use this solution:

1. It is a good practice to use trailing slashes for URLs (`http://www.mysite.com/faq/` is good, `http://www.mysite.com/faq` is not so good).
2. Be careful when using (Jquery) plugins that do not integrate with AngularJS nicely or update in a two-way binding manner, as they may not function nicely in the prerendered HTML snapshot.
3. All URLs in your application should preferrably be absolute URLs, or if you have relative URLs, do add a `<base href="/">` tag.

In any case, you may also create your own staging Grunt workflow incorporating the use of this [grunt-prerender](https://github.com/ericluwj/grunt-prerender) tool.

If you already have static pages that you want to be SEOed, you may even include this tool in your pre-production workflow.

Last but not least, this tool is still currently a Grunt tool, and is not optimized for its usage. A better usage would be as part of a cron task to automate this prerendering.
